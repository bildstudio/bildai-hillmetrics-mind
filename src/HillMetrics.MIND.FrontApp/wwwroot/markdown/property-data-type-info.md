# Property Data Type

The concept of a "property data type" refers to the various ways in which data can be extracted or interpreted from different sources, such as financial data feeds, files, or APIs. Essentially, it defines the method or location from which a specific piece of data can be accessed or derived.

For instance, when extracting the currency from a financial data feed, the data might be explicitly listed in a column or row within a spreadsheet or CSV file. Alternatively, the currency could be inferred or deduced from the amount, such as identifying that a value like "1000â‚¬" refers to euros based on the currency symbol.

The "property data type" helps to categorize where and how the data is located or represented depending on the file format (such as Excel, CSV, HTML, or through an API). For example:

* In an Excel or CSV file, the currency might be located in a specific column or row.
* In an API, the data might be found in a specific key or object.
* In HTML, data could be extracted from specific HTML elements or attributes.

In summary, the "property data type" defines how and where the required data can be found and processed in different file formats or systems. It provides a structured way to access and interpret data efficiently, taking into account both explicit and inferred representations.
